        Welcome to my personal website! My name is <a class="text-shadow-aoc">Nico Foth</a>, and I am a Software Engineer at <a class="text-blue-glow">Lufthansa</a>.
        I am also currently studying applied computer science, which I find to be a fascinating and ever-evolving field.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies. However, what really excites me is working on software projects in my private time.
        I love the creative process of developing something from scratch, and I find it incredibly rewarding to see my ideas come to life in code.
    </p>
    <p>
        On this website, you will find information about my <a class="text-shadow-aoc">personal, as well as professional background</a>.
        You will also find examples of my personal <a class="text-shadow-aoc">projects</a>, which I have worked on in my spare time.
        These projects are a true reflection of my passion for software development, and I am excited to share them with you.
